description: The shortest path to developing a strong foundation for web application development

I believe that in order to become a successful web application developer, it is important to start with a strong understanding of the fundamentals. This understanding can be applied toward learning more advanced topics and picking up new technologies and is more effective than following the latest tutorials to "Build X using Y framework".

## The most important things to learn

_In chronological order_

1. basic shell commands
1. git
1. html
1. css
1. javascript
1. http, sockets, basic network topology
1. serverside programming
1. sql
1. security
1. a currently popular web framework (frontend and backend)
1. basic design principles

If you've made it this far, you should be able to build a web app!

## Advanced topics

1. architecture (frontend and backend)
1. writing maintainable code
1. database performance and tuning
1. devops
1. typescript
1. nosql

If you've made it this far and have shipped multiple non-trivial web apps, you should be able to get a job as a senior software engineer
